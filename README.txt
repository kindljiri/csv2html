There not much to say.
Comma separated format is quite easy to generate by script(I ussually do so).
You can also specify other separator than ,(comma), like ; or : which are often
used as separators in linux/unix enviroment. 
But for presentation on web it's good to have tool which generate the table for 
you automaticaly.

Enjoy :-)
